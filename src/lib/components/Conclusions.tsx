            fundamentalists. The rapidly-expanding Caliphate found in its wake plenty of libraries
            and worthy intellectuals (remnants of the Roman Empire), and they wisely chose to
            preserve and appreciate their value - giving birth to the famous Translation Movement.
            During some time, they even made this learning mandatory. This openness to knowledge
            lasted until Al-Mutawakkil denouced the study of philosophy, and lingered until Al-Qadir
            finally prohibited it, in favour of the literal interpretation of the Koran - which in
            turn brought about their own Dark Ages, which last until today (2024).`}

            himself: "We are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], and
            thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because
            of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body, but because we are carried

              revelation. Only one opinion can be acceptable (that of the Church leaders), and
              dissent is to be punished. From this point onwards, debate was not in matters of logic

              intellectuals from the East to Italy, and the transfer of many surviving works from
              the East to Italy. He is the one who accidentaly inspired the Medici to re-open the
              Platonic Academy in Florence (dedicated not to the study of Plato) which was closed in
              529 by order of the Christian Emperor Justinian I. Plethon was a Hellenistic Pagan who
              carried favour with the Christian Emperor Manuel II, for his renowned wisdom and
              morality. While it would be a stretch to say that he single-handedly caused the
