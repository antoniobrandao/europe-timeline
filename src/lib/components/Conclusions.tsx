            {`Europe went into a period of darkness by the time the School of Athens was closed
            by the Christian Emperor (advised by the Church). At this time, the philosophers were overwhelmingly Pagans
            who resisted Christianity - something the Church perceived as a threat. Around the time of Justinian I (530),
            a doctrine of extreme Christian religious orthodoxy had been fully consolidated. The Church, after taking hold
            of the Emperor and civil institutions, restricted that what was considered acceptable intellectual pursuit
            strictly to Christian orthodoxy.  Christian monks systematically resorted to burning books of
            philosophy, considering them "works of demons".

            {`Religious fanaticism caused by the Christian model of propaganda cultivated a
            climate of fear and terror "for heresy or demon worship" - which could apply to
            literally anything not sanctioned by the church. Even the common folk, not knowing any better, became suspicious of the
            intellectual pursuits of philosophers. During the reign of Justinian, no overt Pagan could expect a public career.
            
            Growing up to become a "famous thinker who
            discovered something" stopped being a viable life goal for aspiring curious children. The remaining philosophers fled to remote areas such as small Greek islands or further away in Syria and Asia Minor,
            and territory of the Islamic Caliphate where philosophical practise was (still) welcomed and embraced.`}

            Dark Ages. While Europe was burning books, killing philosophers for heresy and
            destroying temples, Islamic rulers were proudly compiling and translating the works of
            the ancients, expanding upon them, while expanding their prosperous empire.`}

            preserve and appreciate their value - giving birth to the famous Translation Movement.
            During some time, they even made learning of philosophy mandatory. This openness to open pursuit of
            knowledge lasted until Al-Mutawakkil denouced the study of philosophy, and lingered until Al-Qadir
            finally prohibited it, in favour of the literal interpretation of the Koran - which in
            turn brought about their own Dark Ages, which can be argued lasts until today.`}

            Chartres hence dared to coin the now famous phrase "standing on the shoulders of giants", talking of
            himself in his time: "We are like dwarves perched on the shoulders of giants [the Ancients], and
            thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because
            of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body, but because we are carried

            studying Plato, Aristotle, and the writings of the Neoplatonic philosophers. The only difference
            was the Italian Renaissance, were an additional emphasis was placed on science and in the revival of

            class for prosperity, and all the good that came from economic growth, luxuries and art.
            Therefore in this period the Church largely conceded to the Merchants, and reluctantly lowered
            their grip on the institutions. After all, it was now evident that some agents of the Merchant
            class (like the Medici) held more real power than the pope himself. It can be said that

              polytheists. The end of the multiplicity of points of view, the end of cultural and

              revelation. Only one opinion can be acceptable (that of the Church leaders), and
              dissent is to be punished. From this point onwards, debate was not in matters of logic

              the East to Italy. He is the one who accidentaly inspired the Medici to re-open the
              Platonic Academy in Florence (dedicated not to the study of Plato) which was closed in
              529 by order of the Christian Emperor Justinian I. Plethon was a Hellenistic Pagan who

              morality. While it would be a stretch to say that he single-handedly caused the
